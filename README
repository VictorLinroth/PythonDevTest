This is a small demo made for a test as part of a hiring process for a developer role.

main.py creates an api with two calls, one GET and one POST. Run using "uvicorn main:app --reload" while in the directory.

test_main.py defines some sample unit tests. Run using "pytest".

Required packages to run are fastapi, uvicorn[standard], httpx and pytest for the unit tests. All available through pip.
